There are many unique and interesting ways to use any type of photography. Photos have been around since the 1820s, so they have been around for 200 years now, which is crazy to think about. I remember when I was pretty young, I had this old Sony digital camera. I used to mess around with it all the time and take random pictures of objects around my house or the park outside. Now those photos are long gone because the camera broke, and I never backed them up onto a hard drive or anything. So when I think about those photos, I don't think about the composition or how well lit it was; I think about the memories of taking those photos. Photos were designed to capture specific moments that could be taken as accurately as possible, to show how the human eye sees the world. As technology becomes more and more advanced, the quality of these photos becomes clearer. Now, in this day and age, we have people constantly taking selfies of themselves or taking pictures of unique experiences every day. Photos like these are what is able to shape the current social media environment. I am kind of like that as well, as I like to take photos of myself and the world, too. However, I don't usually check out the contents of the photos. Yes, I would carefully take the picture, but I don't go back to look at it. At most, I would see any cool pictures I've taken and post them on my story on Instagram. I'm not really one to analyze my photos because I don't care about the photo itself. I care about the memory of taking that photo, and thus, taking that photo helps me remember that moment in time. There is photography, but would I think about image making? Usually, I won't change photos I've already taken because I don't check back on those photos. However, I do like to participate in changing images made by other people. I think that image making is about changing other images to make them in your own style. Many people I know like to do edits to different images because they find something special about them. Even though they're not my images, the fact that they are available to the public means the photographer or artist wants people to interact with these images. While there are many uses for photos, and I believe they can be used as a way to remember an event, the passage believes that photos can take us away from reality. Almost everything that is being used in technology nowadays is becoming more corporate with the excessive use of AI. AI images don't have any origin and are artificially made, which takes away from the authenticity of photos. There is a type of feeling of looking back on a photo from decades ago that makes you feel like you were in that specific time period. If AI is used heavily more heavily from now on, then years from now, people will remember the 2020s as the decade where photos became artificial, lacking soul. So I want people who are reading this to picture this: What is your favorite photo of all time?
